In this Open-Ended Problem on Credit card fraud detection using TPOT is proposed. TPOTClassifier is specifically used for classification of the transaction being fraudulent or not. It has come with all built-in preprocessing of dataset that are fed to fit the pipeline and give the best machine learning model with accuracy specified. Then, the dataset is again split into test & train sets which is fed into the DecisionTreeClassifier to fit and the results of testing sets are predicted. Finally, a sample cross validation of testing target and result labels are is performed and visualization is aided by various charts.
